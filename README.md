# Restaurant Journal

This is just a fun little personal project for me that maybe one day I will be putting it on the app store but not right now. If you would like to pull the code down to your local and run npm run ios, you should be able to play around with the app. If you have any suggestions (or if anything is broken or doesn't look right), please let me know! 

Pretty much the idea (and I know its kind of been done before) is that I go out to restaurants because I love food and I keep a journal of the places I've been so I would like to be able to have a simple app that can show me the places I've been by location on a map and journal entries on them so please feel free to use it.
